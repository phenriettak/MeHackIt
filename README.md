MeHackIt
========
Hello.you! 
Mehackit is a place for you to explore and find exercises, craft, events and anything that interest you! 




Hey you! 
Let me hack it is a site for kids to discover events and fun stuff to play and learn. 


This site is made for children to discover interesting things in technology, crafts, design and anything in the 
universe. We'll do our best to keep any content not belonging here out, if you see something, do notify us. 
Have tips? Let us know! 

Explore page: DIY FTW! (once I get an explore page done)
There's almost no rules here. You can build a new widget on this page, embed a game or picture from elsewhere, or bring in 
anything you think kids would get excited about. Tell us , or find our repository
at https://github.com/phenriettak/MeHackIt. 
We don't generate content, but you're free to! We just bring all the cool stuff we find here on display for a while. 
If the feature or link is loved, it'll stay longer as our guest.  
We'd love to see what you come up with. Use your imagination freely- submit tips for games, 
books, pics, hardware hacks, art, crafts, or make something yourself!
